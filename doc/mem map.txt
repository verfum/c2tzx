Addresses 0 to 16383 are assigned to the fixed form of memory, the ROM, and so the first address assigned to RAM is 16384. Table one shows the memory map of the Spectrum: how RAM is used starting at 16384. The display file, for example, which holds the information which is currently displayed on screen, occupies locations 16384 to 22527. The attributes, which determine the colour, brightness and so on, of the screen display, follow immediately afterwards in locations 22528 to 23295.
